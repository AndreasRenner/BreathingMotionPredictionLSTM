# BreathingMotionPredictionLSTM
LSTM network for prediction of the breathing signal obtained from a surface scanner

The Code was used for the Paper "Explicitly encoding the cyclic nature of breathing signal allows for accurate breathing motion prediction in radiotherapy with minimal training data" published in "Physics and Imaging in Radiation Oncology" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phro.2024.100594
